##STAR WARS RPG: D20 EDITION

###introduction
This version of the star wars RPG has a different combat system. Instead of each attack automatically dealing a definite amount of damage, two dice are rolled to determine whether the attack hits, and then how much damage it does if it's a hit.

There are a multitude of object properties added to make this system works.  

First, each character now has an Armor Class (AC for short), this number is the number that an opposing character must roll higher than to hit the character.  

When an attack is made, a D20 function (a simulation of a 20 sided dice) is run, if the roll is above the AC of the defending character, the attack hits. If not, it misses and no damage is done.  Each character also has a toHit property. This is an additional number that is added to each of their attack rolls. This increases as the player makes more hits, acting as a crude leveling system. 

Damage is determined by a roll of a D8, plus an additional modifier. This modifier increases each time the player makes a hit. Acting as a leveling system. 


###Strategy:
There are 4 characters. Luke, Obi-Wan, Darth Vader, and the Emperor. 

It is preferable that you play as Luke and Obi-Wan for a challenge, as Darth Vader and the Emperor are meant to be bosses,but any character is playable. 

Obi-Wan: Does little damage but is hard to hit. Is also very accurate. 

Luke Skywalker: Starts off with Low AC, Low toHit and low base attack. However his base attack increases by a greater number than any other jedi. If luke rolls well in his first fight he will be more powerful than any other Jedi by the end of the game. 

Darth Vader: all around decent stats. Decent AC, attack and toHit. 

Emperor: Easy mode.  Do not play as him if you want a challenge.
